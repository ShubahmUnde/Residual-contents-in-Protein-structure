# supervised-ML-
supervised machine learning
#first uploaded Algorithm is Linear Regression using Ordianry Least Square (OLS)
Data is about Protine 
finding the prediction of RMSD of protine
#To Reduce the Mean Square Error ,we introduced other Ensembels models also
#others model used 1) Linear regression
                   2) Decision tree
                   3) Random Forest
                   4) K nearest neigbours
                   5) SVM regressor
